Extracting financial metrics from Q10 report using RAG on Microsoft Azure | Udacity project

Generative AI introduces a powerful new capability for interpreting financial reports (10-Q filings). It can efficiently extract key activities and financial metrics, enabling investors to quickly access concise summaries and analyses of a company's operations and financial performance. Microsoft Azure further supports this development by offering user-friendly tools for building such capabilities, allowing developers to focus on optimizing prompts to achieve the most accurate and relevant responses from large language models (LLMs).

This project utilizes sample data from NVIDIAâ€™s 10-Q report, available here [Link](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581024000264/nvda-20240728.htm).

The development process is structured into five key stages:
- Setting up the Azure environment
- Uploading the 10-Q report to Azure Storage
- Building a data indexing system
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Development (integrating a large language model (LLM) with the indexed data)
- Fine-tuning prompts and optimizing LLM parameters

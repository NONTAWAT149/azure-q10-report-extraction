Extracting financial metrics from Q10 report using RAG on Microsoft Azure | Udacity project

Generative AI introduces a powerful new capability for interpreting financial reports (10-Q filings). It can efficiently extract key activities and financial metrics, enabling investors to quickly access concise summaries and analyses of a company's operations and financial performance. Microsoft Azure further supports this development by offering user-friendly tools for building such capabilities, allowing developers to focus on optimizing prompts to achieve the most accurate and relevant responses from large language models (LLMs).
